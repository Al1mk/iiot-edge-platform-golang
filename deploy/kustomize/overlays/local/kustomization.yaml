# Local overlay: targets a k3d cluster with images loaded via `k3d image import`.
#
# Tag convention: images are pinned to `dev` here, which matches the Makefile
# default (VERSION=dev). The full local workflow is therefore simply:
#
#   make k3d-up          # first time
#   make k3d-redeploy    # after every code change
#
# For release or staging builds, override VERSION at the make invocation:
#
#   make k3d-load VERSION=v1.2.3
#
# and update newTag below to match before applying.
