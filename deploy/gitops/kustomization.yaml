# GitOps entry-point kustomization.
#
# This file is the target for a FluxCD Kustomization CR.
# It delegates to the kustomize/overlays/local overlay so that both
# `kubectl apply -k deploy/gitops/` and a Flux Kustomization pointing at this
# path produce identical results.
#
# For a production GitOps setup, create a separate overlay
# (e.g. deploy/kustomize/overlays/prod) and point your Flux CR there.
